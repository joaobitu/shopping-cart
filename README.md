# Shopping Cart

An application built with react that uses API calls to populate a Yu Gi Oh card store!
## Funcionalities

- Add Cards to your cart!
- See the added cards as you add them inside the cart!
- Switch between different pages within the same application
- Increase/Decrease the number of a card in the cart
- Display the total based on the items on the Cart!


## Practiced Skills
This project was done using React! one of the key features of it is switching between pages, this was achieved using React Router, a very powerful feature that allows for the user to switch between pages without reloading... and gives me a lot of flexibility to make a SPA (single page application).

Another tool I used was the create-react-app, that gives me a boilerplate react-app with many useful tools built in to it. The idea here is to reduce setup and move with development!
